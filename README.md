# Lending-Club-Case-Study
Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. By using the given dataset we need to identify the risky applicants and minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

- The major goal is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants so that the amount of credit loss can be decreased by reducing such loans. The objective of this case study is to identify such applications using EDA.

- To analyze the variables that are reliable indicators of default in order to comprehend the driving forces (or driver variables) behind loan default. This information can be used by the business for portfolio management and risk analysis.
